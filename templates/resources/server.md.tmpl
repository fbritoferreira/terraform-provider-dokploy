Manages a remote server for Dokploy deployments or builds. Servers can be used to distribute workloads across multiple machines.

## Example Usage

### Basic Server

```terraform
resource "dokploy_ssh_key" "deploy" {
  name        = "deploy-key"
  public_key  = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
  private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
}

resource "dokploy_server" "worker" {
  name        = "worker-1"
  description = "Worker server for deployments"
  ip_address  = "192.168.1.100"
  port        = 22
  username    = "root"
  ssh_key_id  = dokploy_ssh_key.deploy.id
  server_type = "deploy"
}
```

### Build Server

```terraform
resource "dokploy_server" "builder" {
  name        = "build-server"
  description = "Dedicated build server"
  ip_address  = "192.168.1.101"
  port        = 22
  username    = "root"
  ssh_key_id  = dokploy_ssh_key.deploy.id
  server_type = "build"
}
```
